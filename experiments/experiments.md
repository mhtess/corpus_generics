# Comparison class elicitation + prevalence elicitation


## CCEPE-1

- 4/19/17
- Only using items that are not obviously domain restricted (i.e., no "people" or "things").
- Only assuming an NP-focus comparison class.
- Participants generate 3 elements in comparison class (we specified comparison class NP by hand). Later, they rate prevalence.
- n = 20 ($1.25) --> $25 + 40% fee = $35

## CCEPE-2

- 12/11/17
- same setup as CCEPE-1
- tweaked prior elicitation question, and added more instructions
- n = 9 ($1.50) --> $13.5 + 2.7 fee = $16.2
- + n = 9 ($1.50) --> $13.5 + 2.7 fee = $16.2

# Causality judgment

### Switchboard

n = 20 ($1.00) --> $20 + 20% = $24

# Causality + endorsement

- 5/23/17

## Switchboard

#### Prevalence-2

- 12/12/17
- parallel setup to CCEPE-2
- n = 18 ($1.00) --> $18 + 3.6 fee = $21.6
[12/18/17]
+ n = 18 ($1.00) --> $18 + 3.6 = 21.6

#### Prevalence-3

- 12/28/17
- similar to prevalence-2 but with a percentage slider
- n = 18 ($1.00) --> $18 + 3.6 fee = $21.6

# Endorsement (w/ manipulated prevalence)

## Switchboard
- 12/27/17
- analogous to Prevalence task
- "Suppose that, in reality, X% 'have feature'"
- 3 prevalence intervals: 5-15%, 25-35%, 55-65%
- 2 AFC
- goal: n = 20 / item X frequencies
- n = 60 ($1.00) --> $60 + 12 = $72
